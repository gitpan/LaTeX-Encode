LaTeX-Encode
============

LaTeX::Encode exports the function 'latex_encode()' which encodes characters in a string, that
would be incorrectly interpreted by LaTeX.

Additional mappings can be added to the standard encoding table with the 'add_latex_encodings()'
function, while encodings can be removed with the 'remove_latex_encodings()' function.  Additions
and deletions can also be specified on the 'use' statement (e.g.: "use LaTeX::Encode add => { '@'
=> 'AT' };".


The 'latex_encode()' function takes a text string and an optional reference to a hash of options.
The options currently supported are "exclude" to specify a list of characters that should not be
encoded (often this is "\\{}" to allow LaTeX commands to be used in the text string), and
"iquotes" to enable "intelligent quotes", that is double quotes around a phrase will be converted
to "``" and "''" and single quotes to "`" and "'".

Note that 'latex_encode()' will encode a utf8 string (a string with the utf8 flag set) or a
non-utf8 string, which will normally be regarded as ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) and will be upgraded to
utf8.  If you are seeing spurious LaTeX commands in the output then it may be that you are reading
from a UTF-8 input or have data with UTF-8 characters in a literal but the utf8 flag is not being
set correctly.  Refer to the perlunicode, perluniintro and perlunitut manual pages for more details.


The scripts directory contains scripts to help build the character encoding tables used by the
module and to create and format a document listing the characters that the module encodes with
their Unicode character value, HTML entity representation, LaTeX encoding and visual
representation.  These scripts are not installed by "make install".
