LaTeX-Encode
============

LaTeX::Encode exports the function 'latex_encode()' which encodes characters
in a string, that would be incorrectly interpreted by LaTeX.

Additional encodings can be added to the standard encoding table with the
'add_latex_encodings()' function, while encodings can be removed with the
'remove_latex_encodings()' function.  Additions and deletions can also be specified 
on the 'use' statement (e.g.: "use LaTeX::Encode add => { '@' => 'AT' };".


The 'latex_encode()' function takes a text string and an optional
reference to a hash of options.  The options currently supported are
"exclude" to specify a list of characters that should not be encoded
(often this is "\\{}" to allow LaTeX commands to be used in the text
string), and "iquotes" to enable "intelligent quotes", that is double
quotes around a phrase will be converted to "``" and "''" and single
quotes to "`" and "'".

The scripts directory contains scripts to help build the character
encoding tables used by the module and to create and format a document
listing the characters that the module encodes with their Unicode
character value, HTML entity representation, LaTeX encoding and visual
representation.  These scripts are not installed by "make install".
