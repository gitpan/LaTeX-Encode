This "scripts" directory contains a couple of scripts that are not
intended for installation.

The "build-character-table" script probes the tables of HTML entities
to UTF-8 characters (%entity2char) in HTML::Entities and the table of
HTML entities to LaTeX encodings in Pod::LaTeX.  From that information
and some local overrides it builds a UTF-8 character to LaTeX
representation, which it prints out as a version of the
LaTeX::Encode::EncodingTable module, which I use to compare against
the current version in "../lib".  I incorporate any changes that I notice.

The "format-encoding-reference" script probes the encoding table and
creates a LaTeX document (with the help of LaTeX::Table) and formats
it with LaTeX::Driver to create a dvi document that shows all the
characters that are encoded with their Unicode values in hex, their
LaTeX encoding and their formatted representation.
